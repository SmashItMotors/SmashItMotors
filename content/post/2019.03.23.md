I visited the junkyard Saturday, a 2nd Generation Xterra showed up on in my inbox alerts a few days ago and I'm praying it hasn't been picked clean already because I've been waiting for one to show up for months. I had an hour or so before they closed and the vehicle was in a totally different row than specified. Luckily I did find it and someone had done most of the hard work for me; the grill I was also after had been perfectly disconnected and lay on the ground. While fighting the clock to get some other pieces, I suddenly remembered I desperately wanted that heater hose, and was able to get it off quickly after dealing with the broken one several times in the past.
