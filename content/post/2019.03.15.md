There is a plastic piece between the heater core return and the rest of the cooling system. I originally broke it as I was doing a heater core bypass which has since been re-connected. However the plastic piece broke again in a new place and left me semi-stranded. By random chance I had a very little amount of JB Weld Kwik but even if I had the 4-6 hours for that to harden, there's no way I could trust it to hold this thing together. What I ended up doing is using that epoxy to create the "waterproof" seal, then phoned in someone to deliver a stick of JBWeld SteelStick, which I'm now developing an unhealthy relationship with. This stuff is now holding my coolant system together in two places and is almost entirely responsible for holding back all the oil in my Wife's car from gushing out of the cracked oilpan.
