## \#WalkAwayXterra

**MY TRUCK.**

My mechanic is always telling me not to keep cars once they turn 10 years old. One day while he and I were checking under the hood of my 2007 Pontiac G6, some plasic bracket broke. My mechanic picked up a large piece; "GM plastic starts falling apart" he explained as he reduced the plastic to rice-sized bits with a simple one handed crush. That's when I decided it was probably about time to replace the ole Pontiac.

My wife thought we ought to try an SUV and she also likes to spend a little more on cars than I do; a strategy that has kept us from anymore clunkers that can't start half the time.


Later on, I was watching a youtube video on how to determine if a car has been driven mostly on the highway or not. The presenter informs us, if the brake padal has so much wear that you can see metal through the worn rubber, that immediately turns it into a walkaway. I stopped the video and ran out to my Xterra to inspect.

Metal showing through the worn pedal in two places... That's where I get the nickname `WalkAwayXterra`

It's a little rough, but the longer I've had it the more fall in love wiht it. I think the bodystyle is really cool and I've addressed most of the weakest points. I hope.

## \#TheInfinity

My wife Rie is a stay at home mom. She's also living in a nation she didn't grow up in. That can make her feel confined and limited, so one week she dicides she wants to buy a car to give her a little more freedom since she is stuck at home till I bring home the car after work.

Rie is good at browsing craigslist for weeks at a time and finding some interesting deals. Side note: since she doesn't know a whole lot of cars, she'll occasionally bookmark one with a ton of problems that are worded in ways she doesn't understand. Off the top of my head I remember one that said "Engine is shot" but she didn't realize "shot" ment dead.

Anyways one day she spots a fresh listing for a 2006 Infinity. I usually treat all ads like they could be sold in the next hour so we called the seller and hurried over right away once I got the address.

The car ran and drove well. It was being discounted because of a supposed check engine light, but when I drove it all I saw was "Service Engine Soon" and am too honest, I pointed this out to the seller; but as he had already bought his next car, he didn't care to change the asking price. Now this was the first (and still only) time I had come to checkout a luxury brand vehicle. I was a little out of my normal element, especially when I opened the hood and found nothing but engine cover everywhere.

We bought it for the full asking price. It's a very nice vehicle and we enjoy it a lot. But I dread anything breaking on it because part prices are absurd.
