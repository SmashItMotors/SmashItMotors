This is my blog relating primarily to car repair, detailing, and my own cars maintenance or modifications.

The primary pourpose is to share and archive my journey to getting a dealer's liciense. But along the way I am trying my hand at detailing professionally, so there will likely be a wide range of subjects. From November 2018 - March 2019 I bought 6 cars at salvage auction, and some of those projects are still being wrapped up; but I hope to resume that as a hobby in the future.
